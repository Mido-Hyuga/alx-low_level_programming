# C - Function Pointers

In this directory, you will find C programs that demonstrate the usage of function pointers. Function pointers are pointers that point to functions instead of data. They allow you to dynamically choose which function to call at runtime, making your code more flexible and modular.

The programs in this directory cover the following topics:

1. Function Pointers: Understanding what function pointers are and how to use them in your C code. You will learn how to declare and initialize function pointers and use them to call different functions based on runtime conditions.

2. Function Pointer Contents: Exploring what exactly a function pointer holds. Unlike regular data pointers that store memory addresses of variables, function pointers store memory addresses of functions.

3. Function Pointer Memory Location: Understanding where a function pointer points to in the virtual memory. Function pointers point to the memory addresses where the corresponding functions are stored.

By mastering function pointers in C, you can write more dynamic and versatile code, allowing you to implement advanced features and algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code examples and enhance your C programming skills with function pointers.

Happy coding!
