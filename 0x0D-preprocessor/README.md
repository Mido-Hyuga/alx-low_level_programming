# C - Preprocessor

In this directory, you will find C programs that demonstrate the usage of the C preprocessor. The C preprocessor is a part of the compilation process that performs text manipulation before the actual compilation of the code.

The programs in this directory cover the following topics:

1. Macros: Understanding what macros are and how to use them in your C code. Macros are preprocessor directives that allow you to define symbolic names or constants and perform text substitution in your code.

2. Predefined Macros: Learning about the most common predefined macros provided by the C preprocessor. These macros give you information about the system, compiler version, and other important details.

3. Header File Include Guards: Understanding the need for header file include guards and how to use them to prevent multiple inclusion of the same header file in a program.

Feel free to explore the code examples and learn how to leverage the power of the C preprocessor to make your code more efficient and maintainable.

Happy coding!
