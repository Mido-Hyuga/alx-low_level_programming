## Nested Loops
Nested loops in C are loops that are placed inside another loop. They allow repetitive execution of a block of code in a structured and organized manner. With nested loops, you can perform tasks that require multiple levels of iteration. This section will provide examples and explanations on how to effectively use nested loops.

## Functions
Functions in C are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to modularize your code, improve code reusability, and enhance code readability. Functions have a name, a return type (if any), and may accept parameters (input). This section will cover the basics of functions and demonstrate how to define and use them.

## Declaration vs. Definition of a Function
In C, the declaration of a function refers to specifying its name, return type, and parameter types (if any) without providing the function's actual implementation. The definition of a function, on the other hand, includes the implementation, which contains the executable statements of the function. This section will clarify the distinction between function declaration and definition.

## Prototypes
A function prototype is a declaration of a function that provides the necessary information about its name, return type, and parameter types. Prototypes are typically placed at the beginning of a file or in a header file. They serve as a way to inform the compiler about the existence and signature of a function before it is called or defined. This section will explain the concept of function prototypes and their importance.

## Scope of Variables
The scope of a variable in C refers to the region of code where the variable is visible and can be accessed. Understanding variable scope is crucial for writing robust and maintainable code. This section will cover the different types of variable scopes, including global scope and local scope, and discuss the rules and best practices for variable scoping.

## GCC Flags (-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89)
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a widely used compiler for C and other programming languages. It provides several flags that control the compilation process and enable specific behaviors. This section will focus on the following GCC flags:
- `-Wall`: Enables a set of warning messages for potential issues in the code.
- `-Werror`: Treats warnings as errors, causing the compilation to fail if any warnings are encountered.
- `-pedantic`: Enforces strict adherence to the C language standard.
- `-Wextra`: Enables additional warning messages beyond those enabled by `-Wall`.
- `-std=gnu89`: Sets the C language standard to GNU C89.

## Header Files
Header files in C contain function prototypes, macro definitions, and other declarations that are intended to be shared across multiple source files. They provide a way to organize code and enable modular development. This section will explain the purpose of header files, how to create and use them, and how to include them in your code using the `#include` directive.
