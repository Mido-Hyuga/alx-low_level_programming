# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## General
In this section, we will explore advanced concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language.

1. Pointers to Pointers:
   - Understanding the concept of pointers to pointers.
   - Declaring and using pointers to pointers.
   - Double indirection and accessing values through nested pointers.

2. Multidimensional Arrays:
   - Exploring multidimensional arrays.
   - Declaring and initializing multidimensional arrays.
   - Accessing and manipulating elements in multidimensional arrays.
   - Working with arrays of arrays.

3. Standard Library Functions for String Manipulation:
   - Overview of common C standard library functions for string manipulation.
   - Working with strings using functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strlen`, `strcmp`, etc.
   - Understanding the functionality and usage of each function.

Feel free to explore these topics in detail to enhance your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
