# C - More malloc, free

This repository contains C projects that focus on advanced concepts related to memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free`. The projects cover the following topics:

## 1. Using the `exit` function
- Project: [exit_function](./exit_function)
- Description: This project demonstrates how to use the `exit` function in C. It includes examples that showcase different ways to terminate a program using the `exit` function and handle exit statuses.

## 2. Understanding `calloc` and `realloc`
- Project: [calloc_realloc](./calloc_realloc)
- Description: This project explores the functions `calloc` and `realloc` from the standard library. It provides examples that illustrate how to allocate and reallocate memory dynamically using these functions, along with best practices and considerations.

Each project includes its own README file with detailed explanations, code examples, and instructions on how to compile and run the programs.

## Requirements
- C Compiler (e.g., gcc)
- Standard C Library

Feel free to explore and utilize the projects in this repository to enhance your understanding of memory management in C using `malloc`, `free`, `exit`, `calloc`, and `realloc` functions.

Please refer to the individual project directories for more information and instructions on running the code.

**Note:** It's essential to manage memory properly and handle errors appropriately when working with dynamic memory allocation in C.
