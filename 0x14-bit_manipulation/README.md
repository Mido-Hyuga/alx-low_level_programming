# C - Bit Manipulation

## Description
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate bit manipulation techniques. It includes functions for converting binary to integers, printing binary representation of integers, and more.

## Files
1. `0-binary_to_uint.c`: A function that converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.
2. `1-print_binary.c`: A function that prints the binary representation of an unsigned integer.
3. `2-get_bit.c`: A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
4. `3-set_bit.c`: A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
5. `4-clear_bit.c`: A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
6. `5-flip_bits.c`: A function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.
7. `100-get_endianness.c`: A function that checks the endianness of the machine.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o bit_manipulation`).
3. Run the executable to test the various bit manipulation functions.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it as needed, and use it to understand and apply bit manipulation techniques in C programming. Happy coding!
