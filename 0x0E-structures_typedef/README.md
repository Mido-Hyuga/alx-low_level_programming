# C - Structures, Typedef

In this directory, you will find C programs that demonstrate the usage of structures and typedef in C programming.

## Structures

Structures are user-defined data types in C that allow you to group different variables of different data types under a single name. They provide a convenient way to represent complex data structures. The programs in this directory will show you:

- How to define and declare structures.
- How to access members of a structure using the dot (.) operator.
- How to use structures to organize related data efficiently.
- When and why to use structures in your C code.

## Typedef

Typedef is a C keyword that allows you to create your own data type names. It provides a way to define new names for existing data types to improve code readability and maintainability. The programs in this directory will demonstrate:

- How to use typedef to create aliases for data types.
- The benefits of using typedef for clarity and consistency in your code.
- How typedef can make complex declarations easier to understand.

By mastering structures and typedef in C, you can write more organized and concise code, making your programs easier to understand and maintain.

Feel free to explore the code examples and enhance your C programming skills with structures and typedef.

Happy coding!
