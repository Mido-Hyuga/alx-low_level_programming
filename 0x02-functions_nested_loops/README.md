# C - Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains examples and explanations related to C programming language concepts, specifically functions and nested loops.

## Functions

In C, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It helps organize code into modular units, improving readability and maintainability. The following topics are covered in this section:

- **What is a function?**: Understand the concept and purpose of functions in C.
- **Function declaration**: Learn how to declare a function by specifying its return type, name, and parameters.
- **Function definition**: Explore how to define a function by implementing its code block.
- **Function call**: Discover how to invoke a function and use its return value.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops involve placing loops inside other loops. They are used to iterate over a set of elements repeatedly, executing a separate set of iterations for each outer loop iteration. This section covers the following aspects:

- **What are nested loops?**: Learn about the concept of nested loops and their usefulness.
- **Example**: Find a practical example demonstrating the usage of nested loops in C.

Please refer to the individual files in this directory for detailed explanations and code examples related to each topic.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples and code snippets, navigate to the corresponding files in this repository. Each file contains code along with comments and explanations to help you understand the concepts better.
