# C - Debugging

This directory contains examples and information related to the topic of debugging in C programming. It aims to enhance your understanding of debugging concepts and techniques. Please review the following sections for an overview of the contents:

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts and techniques without relying on external resources:

1. **Debugging**: Understand the concept of debugging and its significance in the software development process.

2. **Methods of Debugging**: Explore various methods of debugging code manually, including:

   - Code inspection: Learn how to carefully examine the code to identify potential issues.
   - Print statements: Understand how strategically placed print statements can help trace the flow of execution and identify errors.
   - Divide and conquer: Discover how breaking down the code into smaller parts and testing them individually can assist in locating bugs.
   - Rubber duck debugging: Familiarize yourself with the technique of explaining the code to an inanimate object to uncover errors.

3. **Reading Error Messages**: Gain proficiency in deciphering error messages generated by compilers and runtime environments. Learn how to interpret error messages effectively to identify the root cause of issues.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the examples and information provided, navigate to the respective files in this directory. Each file contains code snippets, explanations, and comments to help you grasp the debugging concepts discussed.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different scenarios. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of debugging techniques and error message interpretation.
