# C Projects: GCC, printf, puts, putchar

Welcome to the C projects repository! This repository contains projects where we apply various concepts related to the GCC compiler and commonly used output functions in C, such as `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`. Each project focuses on different aspects of these topics to enhance our understanding and proficiency in C programming.

## Description

In this repository, we explore projects that involve using the GCC compiler and working with output functions in C. We aim to deepen our understanding of how to compile C code using GCC and effectively use output functions to display information to the console.

By working on these projects, we will become familiar with the syntax and usage of functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`, which are essential for outputting text and values in C programs. Additionally, we will gain hands-on experience with the GCC compiler, understanding how to compile our C code and produce executable files.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice.
3. Read the project instructions and requirements provided in the README file.
4. Implement the necessary C code using your preferred text editor or IDE.
5. Use the GCC compiler to compile your code into an executable file.
6. Run the executable and observe the output.
7. Test and debug your code as needed to ensure it meets the project requirements.
8. Document your code and provide any additional information requested in the project instructions.

Feel free to explore the projects in any order you prefer. Each project will present unique challenges and provide an opportunity to practice using GCC and output functions effectively.

## Project Structure

The projects in this repository follow a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md
├── source-code.c
└── ...
```

Each project directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed project instructions and requirements. The `source-code.c` file contains the C code implementation for the project.
